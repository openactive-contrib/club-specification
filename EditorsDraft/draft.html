<section id="abstract">
This specification describes a simple data specification to support the standardised publication of
organisation or club data. It aligns with the OpenActive data model for opportunities for people to engage
in physical activities ("opportunity data"), which includes description of activities, as well as the events
and locations in which they take place.

OpenActive specifications are intended to support the publication of opportunity data as open data for
anyone to access, use and share. This specification is ideal for those new to publishing open data or those that are not in a position to publish individual dated and timed events or facility slots.
The model may be useful in guiding the development of new and existing systems and applications that consume
opportunity and organisation or club data.

The specification is an output of the [OpenActive Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openactive/)

The data model described in this document has been mapped to existing standards and vocabularies, including
SKOS and the Schema.org types and properties.

## Introduction
Lack of access to up to date information about opportunities for sport and physical activity is a barrier to getting people active. The OpenActive initiative, as a community of representatives from across the sector, has developed a range of data specifications to address this, using data to help people get active.

In our ideal user experience, a person can readily search online for opportunities nearby, find enough detail to understand if the activity is appropriate for their particular circumstances, then directly reserve a place in a class or book a court or facility.

Feedback from the sector shows:

* Many potential activity providers are not yet able to share open data about their sessions and facilities in such detail.
* There is demand for information about activity providers (often sports clubs) in a local area.
* There is no agreed standard, structure or format for sharing such information.

This specification aims to support the sharing of open data about clubs and organisations providing opportunities for activity. By improving consistency in the provision of such data, consumers can have more confidence in data supply and data quality and develop innovative methods to engage potential end-users.

The original [OpenActive Opportunity data model](https://openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/) was centered around Events. This specification is based on the following pattern or profile of elements from that model:

![Club data model](images/Club%20data%20model%20v0.1.png)

**Organization**
An Organization is a basic entity to represent an organization such as a school, NGO, corporation, club, etc. Relevant organization subclasses here include (but are not limited to):

* SportsClub ([https://schema.org/SportsClub](https://schema.org/SportsClub))
* SportsOrganization ([https://schema.org/SportsOrganization](https://schema.org/SportsOrganization))

**Activity**
OpenActive’s primary focus is physical activity \- any exercise, sport or other form of bodily movement that involves physical effort. The recommended approach is to use the [OpenActive Activity List](https://activity-list.openactive.io/en/hierarchical_concepts.html), based on the [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer) standard for publishing controlled vocabularies.

The Activity List describes a set of Physical Activities. An Activity List may be a simple list of activity names, but it can also capture additional information. Examples include alternative names for an activity e.g. "Soccer" is a synonym for "Football". Further, to group activities, we can define "broader" and "narrower" relationships. For example Judo, Karate and Kendo are all more specific examples of the broader activity of "Martial Arts".

**Place**
This specification uses Place as a general concept to refer to all types of locations, venues and facilities. Recognising that clubs will vary in the number and type of premises they may operate from, the specification allows that this Place can be defined flexibly. Examples here include:

* A head office, administrative base or clubhouse
* One or more facilities where the activities take place
</section>
<section>
## Formats

Reflecting the wide variety of tools and platforms in use, and also that the sector is at an early stage in sharing its data more widely, this specification does not prescribe specific data formats or APIs. Club data could be published as JSON, CSV, XML or other formats.

That said, in the examples that follow, we use the JSON-LD format and recommend this approach. JSON-LD offers several advantages, including its widespread use in modem web tools, its readability for both humans and machines, and its compatibility with linked data principles. For more details, see [JSON-LD Best Practices](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-bp/).

The JSON-LD approach is ideally suited for clubs with a website or web page.

OpenActive event data, for sessions and facility slots, are published via the Realtime Paged Data Exchange approach (RPDE).  Alongside this standalone specification, we are proposing an aligned update to the Opportunity Data specification, expanding the representation of organisation/club in the data model, and providing (optional) guidance for publishing club data via RPDE feeds.

This would support ongoing publication of up-to-date information about affiliated clubs from National Governing Bodies, paving the way for the addition of sessions and slots as a club’s data skills and systems evolve.

### Describing Activities

The [OpenActive Activity List](https://activity-list.openactive.io/en/hierarchical_concepts.html) provides an openly licensed standard activity list that can be used by organisations. It is a controlled vocabulary published using the types and properties defined by the [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) standard. That standard allows:

* activities to be organised into hierarchies to capture broader-narrow relationships, e.g. "Martial Arts" and "Judo"
* sharing of alternative labels to support search and indexing
* the sharing of standard codes to support data integration

If you would like to propose additions or improvements to the list please use this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfaKgMC-dySy8G7Lvv_9Uh-o48Db37B3BwHSHANyPlEpiEmFA/viewform).

The following properties from the [SKOS](https://openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/#bib-SKOS) specification can be used to describe physical activities.

| Key | Property | Status | Format | Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| prefLabel | [skos:prefLabel](https://www.w3.org/2009/08/skos-reference/skos.html#prefLabel) | REQUIRED | String | Preferred label for the physical activity.  |

## Worked Examples
### How to use this spec to add standardised machine readable data to a club website.

To illustrate the basic concepts and the JSON-LD representation, consider the following examples, adapted from an existing OpenActive opportunity based at a club.

**Example 1: Starting with the simplest example, using required fields only, in their simplest form.**
(This is for illustrative purposes only and not recommended at all.)

“@context”, “@type” and “@id” are JSON-LD keywords.

The following script could be added at the end of the 'head' tag on the club’s website.

```json-ld
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "@type": "Organization",
    "@id": "https://opensessions.io/api/id/organizers/2572",
    "name": "Greenwich Yacht Club",
    "activity": [
        {
            "@type": "Concept",
            "prefLabel": "Rowing"
        }
    ],
    "location": "Greenwich Yacht Club, London SE10 0BW, UK"
}
</script>
```

However, using the fuller specification allows us to provide much richer information. As this is done consistently between data publishers, data consumers can collate the information more easily.

**Example 2: Using the REQUIRED and Recommended fields, in their recommended forms**
```json-ld
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
    "@context": "https://openactive.io/",
    "@type": "Organization",
    "@id": "https://opensessions.io/api/id/organizers/2572",
    "name": "Greenwich Yacht Club",
    "description": "Community amateur sports club focused on getting people sailing.",
    "url": "http://www.greenwichyachtclub.co.uk",
    "sameAs": [
        "http://www.greenwichyachtclub.co.uk",
        "https://www.facebook.com/GreenwichYachtClub/",
        "https://www.twitter.com/greenwichYC"
    ],
    "activity": [
        {
            "@id": "https://openactive.io/activity-list\#d2733a1c-662c-427a-a270-400171c07320",
            "@type": "Concept",
            "inScheme": "https://openactive.io/activity-list",
            "prefLabel": "Rowing"
        }
    ],
    "location": {
        "@type": "Place",
        "name": "Greenwich Yacht Club, London SE10 0BW, UK",
        "geo": {
            "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
            "latitude": 51.4955,
            "longitude": 0.018473
        },
        "address": {
            "@type": "PostalAddress",
            "streetAddress": "Greenwich Yacht Club, Peartree Wharf, 1 Peartree Way",
            "addressLocality": "Greenwich",
            "addressRegion": "London",
            "postalCode": "SE10 0BW",
            "addressCountry": "UK"
        },
    }
</script>
```
